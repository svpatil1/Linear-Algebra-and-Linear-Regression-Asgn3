 ###### Goal: 

To use linear algebra and co-ordinate ascent algorithm for implementing Linear regression.

###### Observation:

It is observed that implemting the co-ordinate ascent algorithm takes many iterations to get to the solution. Thus it becomes slow to perform a coordinate ascent on a system. So it is recommended to use linear algebra, which simplifies the process.
